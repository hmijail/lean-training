# Lean training

## Usage

The best experience for interacting with Lean is via Visual Studio Code.
First, install the [Lean prover extesion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jroesch.lean).
Then open the top-level directory from this repository in VSCode.
Finally, open the relevant Lean source file (e.g., `src/training2.lean`).
At that point you should be able to intefact with the Lean code, modify, etc and you should see feedback from Lean in the editor.
